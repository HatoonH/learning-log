# learning-log

Imagine that you learned something new and wouldn't want to forgot it, you probably need a place (organized according to what you were learning more recently, and preferably separate in topics) to annotate this and then back to check what you learned. Well, **Learning Log** is a website that track your learning.

> You just need to register an account to make your own *Learning Log*, and list the topics you're learning about. Whenever you learning new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.

Simple like that. :smile:

Learning Log is a starter project made with :heart: using the basics of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). The site style (see image below) is made using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com), and Bootstrap is mobile-first, so its simple but beautiful (and functional, of course :relaxed:).
